# Reef-O-Rama

![Sample Page](https://github.com/storynickolas/beginner-reef/blob/main/Sample%20Images/ReefSamplePage.png)

This app has a basic inventory of popular choices of aquatic life that are often recommended to the beginner saltwater aquarium hobbyist.  Pages are broken into categories including: fish, coral and invertebrates.  If something stands out to you, you can click on the 'add to wishlist' button and it will appear in your wishlist located at the bottom of the screen.  If you change your mind, to remove it from your wishlist click the 'Remove' button.  If you are looking for a certain item you can use the search feature.  This will automatically update the inventory that matches your input as you type.  If you are looking for something and you do not see it you can add it to the inventory through the form on the additions page.
